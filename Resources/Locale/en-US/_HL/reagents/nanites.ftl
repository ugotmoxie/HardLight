reagent-name-inertnanites = inert nanites
reagent-desc-inertnanites = Inactive Synth nanites. Not nearly as dangerous for organic species as their active state, but only actually useful for Synths.
reagent-name-nanites = nanites
reagent-desc-nanites = Synth nanites. Single-handedly responsible for repairing most damage a Synth might encounter. Extremely lethal to organics.
